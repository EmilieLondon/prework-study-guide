# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide helps a new student keep track of the main elements 
they will learn about before starting the bootcamp.
It is also a resource to refer to in the future.

In the process of building this project I have learned how to put together
the building blocks of a basic webpage.

Each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. 
If we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. 
It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
